Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. 
* These cloud computing web services provide a set of primitive abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools. 
* One of these services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. 
* AWS's version of virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).
* The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world, and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary. 
* Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a "Pay-as-you go" model), the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options.


History of AWS
* The AWS platform was launched in July 2002. 
* Then in late 2003, the AWS concept was publicly reformulated.
* In November 2004, the first AWS service launched for public usage: Simple Queue Service (SQS). Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christopher Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service, with a team in Cape Town, South Africa.
* Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14, 2006, combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage, SQS, and EC2.
* The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services, as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003, as a service offered to other developers, web sites, client-side applications, and companies.
* In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had migrated to AWS.
* In April 2015, Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable, with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income.
* In January 2018, Amazon launched an autoscaling service on AWS.
* In November 2018, AWS announced customized ARM cores for use in its servers.


Why AWS?
* AWS comprised more than 90 (165 as of 2019) services spanning a wide range including computing, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things.
* AWS owns a dominant 34% of all cloud (IaaS, PaaS) while the next three competitors Microsoft, Google, and IBM have 11%, 8%, 6% respectively according to Synergy Group.
* Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a "Pay-as-you go" model), the hardware/OS/software/networking features chosen by the subscriber, required availability, redundancy, security, and service options.
* Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. 


AWS Console
* AWS Management Console is a web application for managing Amazon Web Services. 
* AWS Management Console consists of list of various services to choose from. 
* It also provides all information related to our account like billing.
* This console provides an inbuilt user interface to perform AWS tasks like working with Amazon S3 buckets, launching and connecting to Amazon EC2 instances, setting Amazon CloudWatch alarms, etc.
