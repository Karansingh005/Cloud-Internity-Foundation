SQS
* SQS is also known as Simple Queue Service.
* It  is a message queueing service. 
* It is an application integration service through which two decoupled/isolated applications/services can talk/interact with each other. 
* SQS is a pull-based service. This means that we’ve to pull the message from the queue to read it. 
* The message gets deleted from the queue once it's pulled/processed/read.
* SQS can by default retain an unprocessed/unread message for 4 days. (This can varied from 60 seconds to 14 days)
* Message size can range between 1 byte and 256 kb. Extended client library can increase this upto 2 GB by linking it to S3 bucket.
* Useful especially when you want to interact with only one application. If you want to interact with more than one, use SNS (Simple Notification Service).


There are two types of queues supported by Amazon SQS:


1. Standard Queues
* Delivers unlimited messages every second.
* However, ordered delivery of messages is not guaranteed.
* Duplicate messages can get delivered.


2. FIFO 
* First-in-first-out queuing system.
* 300 messages per second is the limit.
* Order of messages is maintained at the time of delivery.


There are two kinds of polling (method of retrieving of messages from queues) supported by Amazon SQS:


1. Short Polling
* By-default
* Returns messages immediately even if the message queue is empty.


2. Long Polling
* More use-cases.
* Waits until the message arrives in queue, or until long polling timeout expires.


Visibility time-out
* It is a time duration, during which messages are invisible in the message queue.
* Useful when multiple applications are interacting with the same message queue. 
* Time duration can vary from 0 seconds to 12 hours (30 seconds by default). 
* This is used when you don’t want another application to process the message when one application is already processing it.
* When this time-out expires, the message can become visible again in the queue.
* However, it can lead to duplicate messages in standard queue.


EMR
* It is a managed cluster platform.
* It simplifies the running of big data frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
* This managed cluster platform is then used to analyze and process large amounts of data.


Cluster
* It is the central component of AWS EMR.
* It is actually a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute (EC2) instances.
* Each instance in this cluster is known as a node.
* Each node has specific software installed to be a distributed application.


Types of node:
1. Master node: 
* Manages the cluster
* It runs software components that helps in distribution of data and tasks among other nodes.
* It keeps track of the overall health of the cluster. 
* It is possible to create a single node cluster with only one master node.


2. Core node:
* Have software components installed to store data and run tasks in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
* Multi node clusters have at-least one core node.


3. Task Node:
* Software components are installed for only performing tasks.
* It does not store any data in HDFS.
* Task nodes are optional.


There are three ways to submit work to a cluster:
1. Provide entire definition of work in functions that are specified as steps while cluster is created.
2. Create a long running cluster for more than one job by using API or CLI.
3. Create cluster, connect to master and other nodes by using SSH. Use interfaces that installed applications provide to perform specific tasks.


We can submit one or more steps. Each step is a unit of work that contains instructions to manipulate data for processing by software installed on the cluster.   


The following is an example process using four steps:                        
1. Submit an input dataset for processing.                                                 
2. Process the output of the first step by using a Pig program.                
3. Process a second input dataset by using a Hive program.                        
4. Write an output dataset.
Steps are run in following sequence:
1. A request is submitted to begin processing steps.
2. The state of all steps is Pending.
3. When a step starts processing, it changes to Running state.
4. When it gets completed, it changes to Completed state.
5. This pattern repeats for all steps.
Amazon Kinesis 
* It is a fully managed service for collecting, processing and analyzing streaming data.
* The data can be streamed from multiple sources.
* Streaming examples: Stock prices, game data, Social Network Data etc.
* Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) is a java library to write data to stream.
There are four types of Kinesis services:
1. Kinesis Data Stream: 
Producers (EC2 instances, Client, Mobile etc.) -> Kinesis data stream (contains number of shards) -> Consumers (Redshift, DynamoDB, S3, EMR)


* You pay per running shard.
* Data can persist in stream for 24 hours (default) to 168 hours.
* Multiple customers, which can be configured manually.
 
2. Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream:
Producers -> Kinesis Firehose (Transform/Compress/Secure) -> Customer (S3, Redshift)


* Only one customer
* Data immediately gets deleted from the stream once it's consumed.
* We pay only when data is ingested. (Cheaper)
* Incoming data can be converted to other few file formats, compress and secure data.


3. Kinesis Video Stream:
Producer (Security cam, Mobile etc.) -> Kinesis Video Stream -> Consumer (Sagemaker, Rekognition,Tensorflow)


* Takes Video and Audio encoded data.
* Output video data to ML and video processing service.


4. Kinesis Data Analytics:
Input Stream -> Data Analytics (<-> SQL) -> Output Stream


* Allows real-time analytics of data.
* You can have specific Firehose or data streams as input and output.
* Data can pass through Data Analytics and is run through custom SQL to provide results.
* Expensive since two streams are required.
