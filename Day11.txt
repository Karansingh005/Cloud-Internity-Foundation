RDS (Relational Database Service)
* It is a web service running "in the cloud" designed to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database for use in applications.
* Administration processes like patching the database software, backing up databases and enabling point-in-time recovery are managed automatically.
* Amazon RDS was first released on 22 October 2009, supporting MySQL databases.
* Support for Oracle Database was added in June 2011, MS SQL in May 2012, PostgreSQL in November 2013 and MariaDB in October 2015.
* Features:
   * Amazon RDS Multi-Availability Zone (AZ) allows users to automatically provision and maintain a synchronous physical or logical “standby” replica, depending on database engine, in a different Availability Zone.
   * Read replicas allow different uses case such as to scale in for read-heavy database workloads.
   * Performance metrics for Amazon RDS are available from the AWS Management Console.
   * Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of RDS DB instances.


Using MySQL on RDS as a service
1. Login to your AWS account. Go to RDS from resources. 
2. Select region and click on create database. 
3. Select “MySQL” database engine.
4. Configure the DB instance by adding values such as engine version, allocated storage, storage type etc.
5. Click next and now configure the networking settings of the instance by adding VPC and subnet.
6. Click create database.


DynamoDB
* Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service that supports key-value and document data structures and is offered by Amazon.com as part of the Amazon Web Services portfolio.
* DynamoDB exposes a similar data model to and derives its name from Dynamo, but has a different underlying implementation.
* Dynamo had a multi-master design requiring the client to resolve version conflicts and DynamoDB uses synchronous replication across multiple data centers for high durability and availability.
* In DynamoDB, there is no query optimizer, and an index is simply another table with a different key (or two) that sits beside the original.
* When a developer creates an index, she creates a new copy of her data, but only the fields that she specifies get copied over (at a minimum, the fields that she indexes on and the original table's primary key). 
* DynamoDB users issue queries directly to their indices. There are two types of indices available. 
* A global secondary index features a partition key (and optional sort key) that's different from the original table's partition key. 
* A local secondary index features the same partition key as the original table, but a different sort key.
* Both indices introduce entirely new query functionality to a DynamoDB database by allowing queries on new keys. 
* Similar to relational database management systems, DynamoDB updates indices automatically on addition/update/deletion, so you must be judicious when creating them or risk slowing down a write-heavy database with a slew of index updates. 
* DynamoDB uses JSON for its syntax.


Using DynamoDB
Creating Table
1. Login to your AWS account. Go to DynamoDB from resources. 
2. In the DynamoDB console, choose Create table.
3. Add Table name. 
4. The partition key is used to spread data across partitions for scalability. It’s important to choose an attribute with a wide range of values and that is likely to have evenly distributed access patterns. You can enable easy sorting with a sort key
5. Next, you will enable DynamoDB auto scaling for your table.
6. Scroll down the screen past Secondary indexes, Provisioned capacity, and Auto Scaling to the Create button.
